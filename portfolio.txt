About me:
I was born in Kyrgyzstan, in Bishkek, but when I was 3, I moved to Germany, where I live now. I can speak Kyrgyz, Russian, German, and English, and I can also translate basic Latin texts.
Around 13 or 14, I wanted to make simple games on Roblox to earn money. I tried learning the "Lua" programming language by myself, but it was tough, so I gave up. After a few years, my dad suggested my mom learn programming. They found a course called Peaksoft in Kyrgyzstan and paid for her to study for 9 months.
But after the first class, my mom realized IT wasn't her thing. She asked if I wanted to take over since the course was already paid for. Knowing it would be hard for my mom, I decided to study in her place. After 6 months, I'm happy I chose to study. Now, I can make simple websites, and it's really cool!
